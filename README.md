Post-Quantum Crypto System Implementation in Python for Seminar Paper @ OpenU IL

## NTRU
NTRU Cryptosystem was added according to the following definitions:
![ntru_set_and_key_creation.png](resources/ntru_set_and_key_creation.png)
![ntru_enc_and_dec.png](resources/ntru_enc_and_dec.png)

## Learning with Errors (LWE)
LWE Cryptosystem as added according to the following definitions:
![lwe_setup.png](resources/lwe_setup.png)
![lwe_key_creation_enc_and_dec.png](resources/lwe_key_creation_enc_and_dec.png)

**Note** - the equation selected for LWE is:
![lwe_updated_alpha.png](resources/lwe_updated_alpha.png)
This was done to ensure that the errors generated from the distribution are within the expected range.
